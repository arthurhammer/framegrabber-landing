<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

**I don't collect any data from you.** Neither personal nor anonymized. Your photos and videos remain completely private. I don't use ads or analytics to track your behaviour.

There's one simple exception: support requests.

## Support Requests

You can email me from within the app. If you want, you can send along some basic diagnostic information (e.g. app and system version, device type). I use this information only to diagnose and resolve your support request. You are completely free to read, review and remove this information before sending.

## Any Questions?

Let me know if I can clarify something for you. Just drop me a line at [hi@arthurhammer.de](mailto:hi@arthurhammer.de).
