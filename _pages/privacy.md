<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

Except during support requests, **I collect no personal or anonymized data from you. Nothing.** Your photos and videos remain completely private. I don't use ads, analytics or third-party services.

## Support Requests

You can email me for support from within the app. If you want, you can send along some basic diagnostic information (e.g. app and system version, device type). I use this information only to diagnose and resolve your support request. If you don't want that, you are completely free to remove this information before sending.

## Any Questions?

Let me know if I can clarify something for you. Just drop me a line at [hi@arthurhammer.de](mailto:hi@arthurhammer.de).
